Bent Spoon Games is a (not yet incorporated) company founded by Alexei
Andreev in 2011. The purpose of this company is to create video games based
on ideas of <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Mysterious_Answers_to_Mysterious_Questions">rationality</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism">transhumanism</a>. Furthermore, I
will try to apply the principles of rationality - rather than discourse - to
the game design discipline. I will try to create games and promote game
design values that don't simply lead to good games, but also promote
awareness of complicated issues that exist in game design: sexism, racism,
addiction, and valuing player's time.

A little bit about me. I've started programming in QBasic when I was 13
years old. From simple text-based games, to short animations, to interactive
games, to 3D engines: I've navigated, learned, and experimented, mostly on
my own. I spent most of my free time during high school and college working
on my own games and game related projects. I've graduated from <a href="http://illinois.edu/">University of
Illinois</a> with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science
in 2009. After that I've worked for over a year at (now defunct) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budcat_Creations">Budcat
Creations</a>. After the studio
was closed by Activision at the end of 2010, I've decided that it was
finally time to make my own commercial game, which resulted in <a href="/gwh">Girl with a
Heart of</a>.
