<p>
Bent Spoon Games is a (not yet incorporated) company founded by Alexei
Andreev in 2011. The purpose of this company is to create video games based
on ideas of rationality<http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Mysterious_Answers_to_Mysterious_Questions>and
transhumanism <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism>. Furthermore, I
will try to apply the principles of rationality - rather than discourse - to
the game design discipline. I will try to create games and promote game
design values that don't simply lead to good games, but also promote
awareness of complicated issues that exist in game design: sexism, racism,
addiction, and valuing player's time.
